# Signed Distance Field Descriptor
This is a file format for describing signed distance field primitives and their combinations.

# Example
This image was generated by intersecting 4 planes and subtracting a circle
![Example image](./example/output.png)


# How to use
```cpp
#define SDFD_IMPLEMENTATION // In one of your translation units before including sdfd.h.
#include <sdfd.hpp>

sdfd::Scene scene = sdfd::load_from_file("file.sdfd"); // To load existing file.

for (auto &obj : scene.objects) {
    // obj.primitives - list of primitive shapes.
    // obj.operations - list operations to perform on them
    Vector2 point = {...}; // where to evaluate sdf, typically pixel position.
    float distance = sdfd::evaluate(scene, obj, point); // get the distance to object at the point.
    if (distance < 0) {
        // Inside the object
    } else {
        // Outside
    }
}

// See example/main.cpp for building shapes using sdfd api.

sdfd::store_to_file(scene, "file.sdfd");
```

# Building example
This project uses [nob.h](https://github.com/tsoding/nob.h).
From root directory: bootstrap, then run nob:
```console
gcc nob.c -o nob
./nob
```
